ServerLogStats
==============

ServerLogStats is a Web App that uses JavaScript and HTML5's FileApi to process Apache/Nginx server logs.  This allows for log processing from within the browser, on the client-side, and without the logs and visitor information ever touching a server. It then generates charts and tables based on visitor info.

As of right now, only the NCSA Common Log Format and Combined Log Format are supported. Using Regex on such large files from within a browser isn't viable, which is the reason for the limited format. The app has been tested on files of up to 200MB in size, and processes them at a rate of ~10MB/s using a 2.4Ghz Core 2 Duo MacBook Pro. You can see it in action at <http://serverlogstats.com/>

In addition, you can run our Jasmine test suite by going to <http://serverlogstats.com/test/SpecRunner.html>
